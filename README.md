Created a full-stack school database application, that users can interact with by getting a list of courses, view details for a specific course, as well as creating, updating, and deleting courses in the database. All is able to view any course, but the creation of one requires a logging in/signing up for an accout. Only the owner of a course can make changes to it(Update, Delete etc). I achieved this through Node.js & Express Authentication mechanism, monitoring who is accessing & controlling what they can do. I built the frontend functionalities with **React**, **JSX**, & **React Context API**. The backend; With **Node.js**, **Express** and **SQL ORM Sequelize**.
Download project folder, navigate to API folder and run "npm install" to install dependencies. Do the same for the client folder. Run "npm start" to run local server.
